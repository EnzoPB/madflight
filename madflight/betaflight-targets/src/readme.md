This folder contains the source for automatically converted Betaflight targets for use with madflight

The conversion is not perfect, but gives working base to start from. Include (or copy/paste) the converted header file in hw_STM32.h

To convert a new batch of files: Copy targets to be converted to the this directory and run program _convert.py
