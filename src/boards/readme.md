This folder (and subfolders) contain board definitions for madflight.

Automatically converted Betaflight targets are in the betaflight sub folder. The conversion is not perfect, but gives working base to start from. Include (or copy/paste) the converted header file in madflight.ino

To convert a new batch of files: Copy the betaflight targets to be converted to the betaflight_source sub directory and run program betaflight_target_converter.py from this directory.
